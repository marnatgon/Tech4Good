0,PatrickSwayzeHips,Reoccurring task clients,TaskRabbit,3.0,1,"I have a client who booked me for every Saturday at 530. She immediately says it will actually be at 615 instead of cancelling/changing the task manually. She has now consistently texted me to change the time and day of the task every single week. This was fine at first since the middle of every Saturday night was not ideal, but now she wants to change the time/day every week. I’ve already explained that she needs to change it through the app and either pay the fee to Tasker or cancel the reoccurring task. She still texts me instead. 

I don’t want to lose this client, but she’s not being respectful of my time and her tasks are getting weirder/more uncomfortable, like personal assistant realm. Am I being inflexible? Do you have clients that text you days before the task like you’re their buddy?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/iycr2i/reoccurring_task_clients/
1,geoffreyqp,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"Get her to confirm in the chat thread the start time. If she cancels/changes and it’s within a day of start time- u can get cancellation fee. However this will probably rub your recurring client the wrong way. Your business, you decide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/iycr2i/reoccurring_task_clients/g6dt74k/
2,PatrickSwayzeHips,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"Thanks so so much for your input, I will probably say exactly what you said there. She texted me today to change this Saturday’s 615pm to tomorrow at 830pm or tonight at 7/730pm. I don’t take same-day cleanings and I can’t/won’t work until 10pm. It would be fine if she needed to reschedule once a month but this has been 3 weeks in a row now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/iycr2i/reoccurring_task_clients/g6bwexy/
3,colorrot,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"How much heads up does she give you? She’s only going to pay the fee if it’s less than 24 hour notice and doesn’t reschedule.

Tell her you have to respect your time and you can’t be that shirt notice because it effects other client appointments",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/iycr2i/reoccurring_task_clients/g6bvyt2/
