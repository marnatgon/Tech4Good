0,villanellepolastri,Tasker charged for travel time- is this allowed?,TaskRabbit,1.0,1,"I hired someone to replace two simple pendant bulbs for me. Should have been a quick task as no drilling was required but it took tasker the whole hour as he did it slightly wrong the first time. I had only booked for an hour as I couldn't really afford to pay more. This meant that the other task he was booked for (screwing a hook to mount a picture frame), did not get done.  

Anyway I have just checked the receipt and he charged me for 2 hours- the other hour being travel time. Is this allowed? I otherwise had no problems with him or the job he did (other than taking longer than necessary).

From my end, there's no way of knowing at the point of booking that the tasker isn't local. When he arrived he was very friendly etc but explained he got caught in traffic as he lives about 45 mins away in good traffic/ so travelled 1+ hours. All well and good but surely this isn't my problem and if a task is far he shouldn't accept the location?

I've never used task rabbit before so willing to accept I'm completely in the wrong and it's normal to pay the full rate for travel. I probably won't do anything about it since its already gone out of my account anyway, but just want to know the position on travel time so I can clarify location with tasker before booking if I ever use task rabbit again.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/f0tgmp/tasker_charged_for_travel_time_is_this_allowed/

2,bogyshi,Seattle tasker question,TaskRabbit,7.0,1,"Hello all, hope you re staying well and healthy during this rather turbulent time.

I wanted to get tasker's opinions on whether or now I should invest my time into being a tasker. My full time job has been postponed by a few months (august to october) and am looking for a way to make some money until then. I am currently in Seattle Washington and curious if someone with some computer skills and strong physique but no car(I bike) has a place on the platform.

Thanks and stay healthy!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gbp5u1/seattle_tasker_question/
3,Opposite_Channel,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"Well you qualify for a certain number of weeks. So apply. Its money you wont get otherwise.  

For webdesign try freelancer.com and such. Plenty of people and small companies need websites built. Do mockups of their site and see if you can sell it to them. 

Im not looking for work. My entire industry is shut down- hotels/casinos. Besides, TR pays more and i only have to work 60- 65 hours to make what i was making at the job that furloughed me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gbp5u1/seattle_tasker_question/fpe70aa/
4,bogyshi,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"Its a fair question, but you hit it on the nose where I want to have some interaction with others (even if its 6ft + apart in masks) and get out of the house. Plus that entrepreneurial spirit you talk about is something I want to hone on. Computer skills for the common person would likely fall into categories of PC setup or construction, and general windows troubleshooting or device setup. I doubt people are looking for much more than that and maybe web design.

Further, as to unemployment, I fear that I may not qualify considering my plan was to be without a job after graduation until June.  

Appreciate all your advice! What kind of work are you looking for (if at all?) Hope youll be starting your job back up soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gbp5u1/seattle_tasker_question/fpe60a5/
5,Opposite_Channel,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"As another person suggested: why not apply for unemployment? 

Im in the same situation and started TaskRabbit the week before all of the shutdowns because my new job was not paying enough. Good thing too because the job laid us all off and we're thinking itll be August when we are rehired back, but im on unemployment until then.

Now TR gets me out of the house, keeps me engaged and a goal to look forward to. I think its human nature to want a reason to wake up, interact with other people and earn a living no matter how small. 

To answer your question: every entrepreneur has a place on TR. If you have sellable skills and are confident in your ability to help people then youll do fine. I havent seen computer skills offered on the site  so what computer skills do you have? Helping people move is always needed even if you dont have a car. You may want to consider renting a truck when you get the task and include that in your price.  I cant tell you how many times i needed help moving and it was hard to find a friend that would show up on time or at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gbp5u1/seattle_tasker_question/fpdfeeq/

10,Opposite_Channel,Charging a min,TaskRabbit,5.0,1,"So for deliveries outside my main area i went with a 1.5 hr minimum.  I live in a major city where TaskRabbit isnt well used. I feel its the best way to be fair to my finances while still being available to people like options. If they can't understand the 1.5 hr minimum charge then they can choose another Tasker or find another way to get their task done.

I was hired by one client and informed them before i accepted the task about the charge. Although the pickup was in my region the drop off wasnt and if they were okay with the charge. They went on to give me logistics of how quick the task was not understanding that i have to drive back to point A and im not getting paid for that leg of the trip if i only charged 1 hr.

 Their total cost would be $30 instead of $20. If i only charged $20 after gas expenses i was only walking home with $11. Thats not worth going out of my way for or arguing about so i forfeited the task.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gh5xre/charging_a_min/
11,Red-Sleigh,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"I agree either up your rate or reduce your work area. Or both.

When I started tasking, I had a wide work area, partly because I thought I would get hired a lot more for organizing, office work, and personal services. I figured out pretty quickly that:    
1) Delivery was my number one task.   
2) I needed to stop wasting time driving on my own time and my own dime between tasks.   

I narrowed my range to the area I was getting the most work. It was a range about 6 x 6 miles. So my longest possible travel time between tasks is less than 30 min and usually 10-20 min. Back when work was flowing, I could stack up the tasks and book the invoices.

The other advantage of having a narrow range is then if someone wants a pickup inside your range with a dropoff outside...then you can legit charge them for the time for return trip. I usually tell them politely that that they can pay for the return trip or if they dont want to, its no problem, just cancel the task.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gh5xre/charging_a_min/fqa7ufk/
12,bryanalexander,,TaskRabbit,,2,,"The point is, you are charging to little for your services and bringing down everyone’s rate by doing so. Just up your rate and move on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gh5xre/charging_a_min/fq7qnex/
13,geoffreyqp,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"I agree with this, he should raise his rates or draw a smaller work area. But I do want to add that the delivery was outside his work area, so forfeiting it should be fine if the customer doesn’t want to pay for the extra drive time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gh5xre/charging_a_min/fq7dltt/
14,Opposite_Channel,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"Charging a 1.5 hour rate for EVERY task doesnt make sense for tasks that are within my area. Im penalizing 95% of my clients because of 5% of my customers? Thats just bad business. Terms of service say you have to charge in 15 increments which is what im doing. As long as the client is informed in advance they can make the decision if they want to proceed or not. 

In regards to increasing my rate my area doesnt support a $50 delivery. Heck ive tried $25 delivery and those taskers just dont get booked as often. Most of us are in the $20-30 range and one tasker is in the $117 range because he does moving. We charge what our market can bear, but thanks for your input.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gh5xre/charging_a_min/fq6nt58/
15,DnaK,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"1: It's against Taskrabbits TOS to charge anything other than their 1 hour minimum, outside of that it is supposed to be billed in 15 min increments and support will not help you regarding minimum times and might issue a reprimand. 

I suggest you increase your rates.  Stop charging a 1.5 hour minimum and just make that 1.5 hour rate your hourly rate, and adjust from there.  My delivery fees include the all the gas I could possibly use driving for an hour(and back) + overhead + hourly payment.  It's set right now for 50/hr.  15/hr of that is fuel expenses, 10/hr is maintenance/insurance overhead, and 25 is my hourly take-home.  For reference, I drive a pickup and I typically get orders that involve large items.  A 50 dollar charge to deliver anything is VERY reasonable when you consider the fact a store will charge over 100.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/gh5xre/charging_a_min/fq6mkpu/
