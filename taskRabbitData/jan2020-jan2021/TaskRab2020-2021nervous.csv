0,ItssRandy,Insurance? Sole proprietorship? Llc?,TaskRabbit,6.0,1,"Hey fellow Taskers,

(Sorry if repeat question)

I recently signed up and having a blast. Made some great cash and met some cool people. 

I got a little nervous though because I didn't think of the repercussions if something goes wrong. Hit a pipe, electrical, break something etc. 

TR really has a no insurance policy in place. 


Do you guys have business insurance? LLC? SP?

TIA!",,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/hin274/insurance_sole_proprietorship_llc/

3,highest-baller,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"No need for LLC, unless you live in a State it’s cheap to form one (I’m in California, LLC fee is $800/year) if you’re in Nevada, Texas, Florida.. yeah, go for it.

NEXT insurance is a very popular one for a GLI, it will be about $50/mo. It’s a smart decision depending on what you do. If you offer painting/power washing/minor repairs/plumbing jobs, 100% go get it. 

And drilling into pipes is something 100% avoidable if you know a little bit about construction. Don’t worry about that. If you’re worried about hitting electrical, buy a decent stud finder that can detect wire behind wall.

But insurance for Furniture Assembly and moving jobs? Only if you’re handling very expensive stuff. 99% of the time is IKEA which is replaceable and cheap.

Corporate clients usually ask insurance if you perform work inside commercial buildings, fyi.

In short, just run a Sole Proprietorship until makes financial sense to run a LLC. Get insurance but make sure it cover your scope of work.

Hope that helps! Good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/hin274/insurance_sole_proprietorship_llc/fwrz2f8/

6,DnaK,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"I have business liability to cover the variety of handyman related tasks I do both on and off this platform.  That is it though, no workman's comp for myself or unemployment insurances.

You are absolutely right to be worried.  Taskrabbit does't want to tell you directly, but their ""happiness pledge"" only takes effect once their homeowner's insurance denies the claim.  And it's very possible for the homeowners insurance company to come after you prior to getting to the ""happiness pledge"" liability they offer.

7,farnhakw,Have you ever been hit on by a drunk client?,TaskRabbit,9.0,1,"The other day I (30's male) did a job for a ganetleman at around noon, and he was drunk already. We were talking, and as I worked he abruptly said 'can I touch you?' I said 'huh?' and he said 'I'll give you more money.' I cringed a bit and said no thank you, I'm straight. Luckily the job was about 5 minutes away from being done, during which time I worked quickly, and he sat on the couch embarrassed. He then said 'I'm sorry I'm such a slut!!!' I said don't worry about it and left.

Anything like that ever happen to you all? I've actually had women drop hints that they were interested, but I never acted on it because I'm too nervous I'll misread a signal, offend her, and then she'll complain and I'll be kicked off the app. Has anyone ever dated a Tasker or client?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/jsj92l/have_you_ever_been_hit_on_by_a_drunk_client/
8,jethropenistei-,,TaskRabbit,,1,,The client would have to do something really overt like the OP for me to realize I was being hit on because I’m really dense when it comes to social situations.

10,Red-Sleigh,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"I had a regular out of town client who hired me to go to a special sale and ship the items to him. It was a fun store and one time i told my client that I hoped he would make it in town because the store was a lot of fun. I meant it face value, but after I sent the bill for the task he dropped his number on the chat and invited me to call any time. I was ever so slightly off-put, hut since it was friendly and not creepy, it was easy to ignore and move on.

14,farnhakw,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"Yea man, I had a beautiful woman in her 50s (she looked 30, I was stunned by how young she seemed) begin talking to me about writing. I had recently written a book (Still editing it now) and it turned out she was a popular erotic/romance writer who had published about a dozen novels. We ended up talking for like half an hour after I mounted her TV and the conversation got pretty deep. She started making long eye contact with me and breathing heavily, and I realized she was swooning right in front of me. What did I do? Having never anticipated what I might do in this situation, and considering I was at work, I completely chickened out and did nothing. 

I told my friends about this later and took a bunch of crap, like 'dude she was begging you to make a move!' But, I don't exactly regret not doing anything even now, that's a great way to get booted from the app. Who knows what might have happened or how she might have felt afterwards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/jsj92l/have_you_ever_been_hit_on_by_a_drunk_client/gbzs2b2/
15,shortfriday,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"Been hit on a tiny handful of times by clients, definitely more gay guys than women (I'm a dude). It's almost worse when it's subtle because you can't put a stop to it more concretely. The one time it was really explicit (she got out juice and a giant bottle of vodka and offered me some) I made it clear that I had another job to get to afterward and then tried to keep it just slightly beyond business friendly so she wasn't totally embarrassed, overall a nerve-wracking, awful time. The one time I almost risked it all was with a beautiful, ""adventurous"" late 40ish woman from the netherlands who spent the whole time talking to me about her love life and all the men she'd met traveling the world. Did the math in my head and... yea, I'm not cool enough to make out with someone at work.
