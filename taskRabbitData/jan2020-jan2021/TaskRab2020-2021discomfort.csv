0,dragonbeard91,Trying not to let a horrible review bring me down,TaskRabbit,8.0,1,"Hello all, I've been tasking since October and things have been really good. All of me reviews have been positive ones and about 1/3 of my clients write a review. Last month however I did a day of work for a client who ended up being unstable. She left for the entirety of the task to a bar and returned intoxicated, where she threatened and intimidated me until I had to  voice my discomfort and leave. I told her I would return for calms sake but I had no intention of doing so. Her one star review is basically a fabrication, and I believe a result of me reporting her to taskrabbit. However I took no pictures so its her word against mine. 

Support doesn't care even though I've screenshot the parts if our ToA where it addresses attacks on reputation as grounds for removal. They will not remove it anyway. I'm starting to feel like things are exceptionally slow because new clients are put off by a 1 star review claiming that I overcharged and ""took advantage of a disabled old woman!""",,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/
1,shortfriday,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"I’ll look up my correspondence with tasker support, but I remember that I explicitly wrote them to announce that I had been in physical danger at the task location and to request that my metrics and ratings not be effected, and I think they assured me that they wouldn’t be. One of the clients I left was a person who had an actual anxiety attack in front of me because I told them that the cleaning and organization of their hoarder apartment wasn’t possible and I ended up literally packing up my gear and fleeing as they screamed protests at me, so I think that there’s a chance they were acutely blocked from reviewing. I know for sure that I didn’t get an incomplete/late cancel (I’ve never gotten one of those) so I think that my writing to support might have “zapped” the booking away in some sense.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/fgynm8h/
2,jawz_part_99,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"once a task is accepted, the client can review, whether or not the task is completed or billed or whatever.
you have to weed out the crazy before accepting the task. 
once accepted, even if you cancel, they can rate you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/fgwyjzl/

4,jethropenistei-,,TaskRabbit,,1,,They never wrote reviews but must’ve contacted TR support after the fact. I saw a comment on this subreddit where the person said they had success getting a review removed because it came from a month after the job idk if there was any other reason as to why it might’ve been removed. It’s probably very rare to get them removed with weeks of back and forth with TR support.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/fgl4k8a/
5,destroyai,,TaskRabbit,,1,,As far as I understand TaskRabbit won't remove reviews. But they'll fix any metrics problems. Not sure what the logic is there but that's what I've experienced.,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/fgkhoe7/
6,shortfriday,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"I've had two legitimately crazy clients in my 6 years on the platform. If you can really smell it on them, make up an excuse and gtfo without billing and email TR saying they were drunk or something. I lost a full commute and about $200 in revenue on each of them but not having to worry about a review was worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/fgk11v2/
7,dragonbeard91,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"So they never left reviews, or did taskrabbit remove them? This was written over a week after the task as well and I believe to be revenge for reporting her",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/fgjr63v/
8,jethropenistei-,,TaskRabbit,,1,,"I’m sorry that they wont help you out. I dread getting a bad one and hoped they’d support their taskers when customers leave unfair reviews. I’ve been lucky that the two times I’ve been reported by two customer but both were over a week after the fact. One was a woman who got angry when I turned off a fuse so that I wouldn’t get electrocuted doing some wiring. The other was a guy who said that I scratched the walls of his apt building  while moving a couch (we moved the couch together so he was equally responsible and said he did not care). Task rabbit reached out for clarification but nothing happened to me as a result.

Edit: with the first woman I almost walked out on the job cause I knew she was gonna be a problem. I was worried about a negative review so I stayed and just tried t kill her with kindness. Sadly, I think the only thing you can do to avoid the negative review altogether would be to forfeit the job saying the clients expectations are unrealistic. However, idk that for sure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TaskRabbit/comments/eyuztp/trying_not_to_let_a_horrible_review_bring_me_down/fgjolg3/
