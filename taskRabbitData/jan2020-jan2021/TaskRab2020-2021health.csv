We need your help. The coronavirus pandemic is having devastating financial consequences on the financial health of Canadians. We want to understand how Canadians are coping during this pandemic to make pointed recommendations to fintechs and financial institutions on how to build and tailor their products to help Canadians build resilience and better respond financially to crises.

Please fill out this survey and circulate to friends, and family. We promise to share our findings widely over the coming weeks.
